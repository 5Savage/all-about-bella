      <p>
        Bella is a toy poodle which is the second smallest of the four sizes
        that poodles come in. There's a standard, miniture, toy, and teacup
        poodle, however, Bella is the perfect size for cuddles. Something many
        people don't know about Bella is that she's a senior dog and is 13 years
        old. Due to her size, many people believe she's a puppy despite all of
        her gray hairs. Some fun facts about Bella are that she loves to eat
        scrambled eggs, sun bathe, play with her toys and receive belly rubs. I
        love that she let's me take photos of her because she's so photogenic.
        If you would like to keep up with Bella, her virtual photo album will be
        linked below!
